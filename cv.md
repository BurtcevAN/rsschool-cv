## **Summary**
Iâ€™m 34. 

I have built a career twice. I have good management experience.

I had an opportunity to work for the international company National Oilwell Varco(NOV) for 6 years. I grew there from a Trainee to a Manager. I participated in a Next Generation corporate program. During the program, I took Internal corporate training and online courses to develop personal qualities. I trained in Norway for 3 months and practiced and strengthened my communication skills in English and developed professional skills. I participated in the launch of the plant. Likewise, I created the Metrological provision process, which meets the standards and regulatory technical documentation of two countries, the Russian Federation and the USA standards. 


My last workplace was a regional metrology center where I started as a trainee in conclusion of my career, I had under my managed 5 departments and 42 workers.
I started looking into the IT area in June. And for this moment I devote all my time to learning and developing skills to meet the requirements and to get the job as a Frontend developer.
